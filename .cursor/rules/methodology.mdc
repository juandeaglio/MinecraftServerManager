Iterate on the code to make changes within 10 minutes.
Keep changes small and concise.
Only modify one of two choices: 1) one test case or source files.
Only one thing should change at a time.
Explanations should be concise.
Using TDD, changes will be limited to either only a refactor, only add a failing test, or only write code to pass the test. 
Execute tests after the changes.
Test via `make unit-test` or `make integration-test`
