Only one change per prompt.
Keep change small and concise.
Only modify one of two choices: 1) one test case or 2) source files.
Explanations should be minimal/non-existent.
Do not explain after running tests.
TDD: Changes will be limited to either only a refactor, only add a failing test, or only writing as little code as possible to pass the test. 
Execute tests after the changes.
Test via ONLY running this command `make unit-test` or this command `make integration-test`.
